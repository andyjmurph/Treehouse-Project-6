#SVG Site Update [Treehouse Techdegree Project 6]

In this project, you'll be given a website with rasterized images (PNG files) along with matching SVG files. You'll need to replace the rasterized images and modernize the UI using the SVGs. :smile: :+1:

##Instructions

###Background

* Replace the background pattern PNG with the matching SVG (background.svg)

###Logo

* Replace rasterized PNG logo with the SVG logo image (logo.svg) using the inline SVG method to add it.
* Ensure the logo SVG is the styled to the same size as the original PNG (140px x 120px).
* At a page width of less than 425 pixels, remove the text from the logo and add an H1 tag that contains the logo text.

###Dog Images

* Replace the dog images with SVG images using the  tag.
* Size the dog SVGs to 170px x 170px to match the original PNGs.

###Menu icons

* Change icons in the menu from rasterized images to inline SVGs.
* When a user hovers over a nav menu item, use CSS to change the color of both the text AND the inline SVG.

##Extra Credit

* Add CSS transitions to the menu icons hover states
* Use inline SVGs for the images of the dogs and then change the color of the dogs' coats using a CSS style sheet so that each dog has a different coat color.
* You can find the original colors used by looking at the CSS <style> tags within the SVG dog files.
